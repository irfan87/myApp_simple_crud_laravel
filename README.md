# Simple CRUD Application

This is a Laravel-based application showcasing my skills in building a basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) system. The app currently functions similarly to a to-do list, but with potential for expansion beyond simple task management.

## Current Features

-   Basic CRUD operations for managing tasks or records.

## Ongoing Development

-   User authentication for secured access.
